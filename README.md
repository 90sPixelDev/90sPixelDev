# About Me
👋 Hello, I am **@90sPixelDev**, my given name is Lien Font (pronounced like LEE-AN)

👀 My main hobbies are programming, 3D art, and video games

🌱 I’m currently busy with work but like to work on my personal passion projects such as a Sims Family Tree Web App (private ATM) and finishing my most recent web app ***[RP Rooms](https://github.com/90sPixelDev/rp-rooms)*** created with **React**, **Firebase**, and **Tailwind**. When relaxing I like to work on my ~~Unity Multiplayer~~ game as well as my Unreal Engine survival game

💞️ I am not looking for anything at the moment but ideas for things to create are always welcome!

📫 You can reach me through my email at fontlien@gmail.com
