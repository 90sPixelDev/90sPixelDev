# About Me
👋 Hello, I am **@90sPixelDev**, my given name is Lien Font (pronounced like LEE-AN)

👀 My main hobbies are programming, 3D art, and video games

🌱 I’m currently looking for fulltime work and like to work on my personal passion projects such as a Sims Family Tree Web App (private ATM) and finishing my most recent web app ***[RP Rooms](https://github.com/90sPixelDev/rp-rooms)*** created with **React**, **Firebase**, and **Tailwind**. When relaxing I like to work on my ~~Unity Multiplayer~~ game as well as my Unreal Engine survival game
